# mod-orphan

Linux networking modules that were removed from the kernel tree because
nobody maintained them and they had too many bugs, kept here as
out-of-tree modules so that the people who still use them can keep
running them.

This repository is also where the **AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE fixes** are
developed, reviewed and merged before they are sent to the stable and
long-term kernels that still carry these protocols in-tree.

## Contents

| Subsystem | Modules | Removed from the kernel by |
|---|---|---|
| Amateur radio | `ax25`, `netrom`, `rose`, and the drivers `6pack`, `baycom_*`, `bpqether`, `hdlcdrv`, `mkiss`, `scc`, `yam` | commit 32bb4a38e352 ("net: remove amateur radio (hamradio) subsystem") |
| ATM | `clip`, `lec`, `mpoa` and the PCI/SBUS drivers (ATM core, PPPoA, br2684, solos-pci and the USB DSL drivers went back in-tree) | commit c29fbdee0b9d ("net: remove ATM networking subsystem") |
| ISDN | `mISDN_core`, `mISDN_dsp`, `l1oip`, the mISDN hardware drivers, `kernelcapi` and Bluetooth `cmtp` | commit afee2aa98a00 ("net: remove ISDN subsystem and Bluetooth CMTP") |
| AppleTalk | `appletalk` (DDP, AARP) | removal of the AppleTalk protocol |

The code is the in-tree code at the time of removal, with only the
changes needed to build outside the tree. Each import commit lists
these changes. Examples: `dev->ax25_ptr` and `dev->atalk_ptr` no longer
exist in `struct net_device`, so the modules keep their own lists, and
local copies of the removed headers are used instead of the kernel's.

## Building

You need the headers or the build tree of the kernel you run.

```sh
make                          # against the running kernel
make KDIR=/path/to/kernel     # against another kernel tree
sudo make install             # modules_install, then: sudo depmod -a
make clean
```

`include/hamradio_compat.h` supplies helpers that are missing from older
kernels, so the same sources also build on kernels that still have the
subsystems in-tree (6.12.y, 6.18.y, 7.0). The modules built here then
replace the in-tree ones, which is how the AX.25 fixes are tested on
live networks before they reach a stable release.

Always build on the machine that will load the modules, or against the
exact build tree of its kernel: a matching `uname -r` alone is not enough
to guarantee a compatible module.

AppleTalk needs `CONFIG_LLC` in the host kernel (see
`net/appletalk/Kbuild`).

## Amateur radio: AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE

### What AX.25 is

AX.25 is the link layer protocol of amateur packet radio. It was derived
from X.25 by radio amateurs in the early 1980s and standardised as
AX.25 version 2.0 in 1984. Each station is identified by its callsign,
and frames can be relayed by other stations ("digipeaters"). With AX.25,
amateur radio operators send messages, files and data by radio, without
any commercial network:

- on VHF and UHF, most often at 1200 bit/s (AFSK) or 9600 bit/s (G3RUH
  FSK), and on HF at lower speeds;
- through amateur satellites and the International Space Station: the
  PACSAT store-and-forward satellites, and the APRS digipeaters in orbit;
- with APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System), which sends position
  reports, weather data and short messages in AX.25 frames;
- through bulletin board systems (BBS) that forward personal messages
  and bulletins between themselves around the world.

Above AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE add a network layer, so that a user can
reach a distant station across a chain of nodes:

- **NET/ROM** builds its routes automatically from the broadcasts of
  neighbouring nodes;
- **ROSE** (X.25 packet layer protocol over AX.25) routes calls by
  address, much like the X.25 public data networks it was derived from.
  Its addresses use an X.121 numbering plan (DNIC + area + node).

### AX.25 and the Internet

AX.25 was tied to the Internet from the beginning. IP over AX.25 has
worked since the mid-1980s (notably with Phil Karn's KA9Q NOS), ARP has a
hardware type for AX.25, and since 1981 radio amateurs have had their
own IPv4 address block, 44.0.0.0/8 (AMPRNet). So TCP/IP has run on radio
links for decades, and packet radio networks are linked to each other
over the Internet: AX.25 frames are carried in UDP or IP datagrams
(`ax25ipd`, `bpqether` on Ethernet), which lets nodes on different
continents talk as if they were neighbours on the air.

Linux has supported AX.25 almost since its first releases. It includes
NET/ROM and ROSE sockets, KISS interfaces (`mkiss`, `6pack`), interfaces
for the classic packet radio cards (`scc`, `baycom`, `yam`), and AX.25
over Ethernet (`bpqether`). The user space side is the `ax25-tools` and
`ax25-apps` packages, with programs such as `kissattach`, `ax25d`,
`ax25ipd`, `netromd` and `call`. On top of these run full node and BBS
packages such as FPAC (ROSE/NET/ROM node) and LinFBB (BBS).

### Where the AX.25 fixes come from

Many amateur radio networks run on Linux, from Raspberry Pi nodes at
home to gateways linking whole countries. The ROSE and NET/ROM networks
connected to the F6BVP nodes in France, and their links abroad, depend
directly on these kernel modules.

When the amateur radio subsystem was removed from the kernel because
of its bug count, the bugs did not go away for the people who use it.
Since May 2026, Bernard Pidoux, F6BVP, a long-time contributor to the
Linux ROSE code and to the FPAC node software, has used this repository
to fix them. The fixes:

- come from failures seen on real packet radio links and from syzbot
  reports: reference leaks, use-after-free, races at module removal and
  on device shutdown, ROSE circuits that are never released, AX.25 links
  that stall after a retransmission, unchecked frame lengths in AX.25
  and NET/ROM;
- run for days on a live network of eight Linux nodes (Raspberry Pi and
  PC, kernels 5.4 to 7.0) with real packet radio traffic before they are
  proposed;
- are reviewed here as pull requests and merged into `main`;
- are then picked up by the stable maintainers for the long-term
  kernels that still contain these protocols (6.12.y and 6.18.y).

To see which stable and long-term releases already contain each fix,
and when they reach Raspberry Pi kernels, see

## Contributing

- Open a pull request against `main`, one fix per commit, with a commit
  message in the kernel style: `subsystem: summary`, an explanation of
  the bug and of the fix, `Fixes:` when relevant, and `Signed-off-by:`.
- For amateur radio, say how the fix was tested, and if possible test
  it on a real link or with realistic traffic.
- Discussion of the amateur radio protocols takes place on the
  linux-hams mailing list (<linux-hams@vger.kernel.org>).
